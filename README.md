To create a snake game for my college project

#H1 Manual

#H2 Overview
This is a basic snake game, starting off with the player maneuvering a dot around the screen, growing into a snake by increasing in length as it eats apples along the way.

#H2 Rules 
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself. A 'game over' screen will be displayed asking the player whether they want to restart the game or quit.


#H2 Rules/controls
Use the left/right and up/down keys on the computer keyborad to start and move the snake around the screen.
